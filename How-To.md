## 6. Create a new branch for modification

```bash
git checkout -b smallfix
```

and then update the code snippet mentioned in the guide

**Do not make changes directlly in the master branch**

## 7. Merge upstream in case the origin project changes

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio.git

git fetch upstream

git merge upstream/master
```

## 8. Validating the code style etc.

```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

You shall see SUCCESS if all checks pass

## 9. Commit and Push your updates to repository online

```bash
git add . -A

git commit -m 'STATE WHAT YOU HAVE CHANGED BRIEFLY HERE'

git push origin smallfix
```
